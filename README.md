# NAKFI-Ocean-Viewer
A tool to view marine habitat space in three dimensions. Users input a variety of water chemistry parameters, data is fetched from a predictive model, and the returned habitat space is displayed in 3d.

This project is funded by a grant from the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative. My supervisors are Julie Spivey, and Dr. Patricia Yager at the University of Georgia.

A demo of the current version can be found [here.](http://mappingthedeep.uga.edu/ocean-viewer)
